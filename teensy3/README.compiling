Compiling
=========

Firstly, make sure you've read:
   https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gcc.html

Debian (and derivatives, like Ubuntu)
-------------------------------------
If you read stuff in the link above, you'll probably
have installed the following by now:

   apt-get install gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc

Additionally, the gcc-arm-none-eabi package is required,
so run the following command to install it:

   apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi

Build paths
-----------
If you'd like to use Arduino, you'll have to make sure
that your ARDUINOPATH is correctly set.

If you don't like, or do not want to use Arduino, you can
simply set the NO_ARDUINO environment variable before building:

   NO_ARDUINO=1 make
